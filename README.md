# MyLibrary

MyLibrary is a simple and clean web-based library application that allows users to keep track of books they have read or plan to read. It provides an easy interface to add new books, remove books, and toggle their reading status.

## Features

- ➕ **Add new books** with title, author, page count, and read status  
- ❌ **Remove books** from the library  
- 🔄 **Toggle read status** of any book  
- 🗂️ **Organized display** of all books in a grid layout  
- 💾 **Persistent data** using JavaScript objects (no backend required)

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – structure of the app  
- **CSS** – styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – app logic, DOM manipulation, object handling  

---

## How It Works

MyLibrary uses a simple JavaScript Book constructor or class (depending on your implementation) to create book objects.  
Books are stored inside an array representing the current library.  
Each book can be displayed, toggled, or removed through DOM interaction.
